# The-incredibles

Walk the plank with a scary twist!
This VR game was developed using Unity Engine over the span of 8 weeks.

The purpose of the game is to create a real sense of height and start the adrenaline pumping through the player's veins while walking across a wooden, broken-down bridge over a deep gorge. 
To add a bit of extra tension, you are also followed by a hungry polar bear while being attacked by bats.
Your only hope of surviving is getting across the bridge safely, picking yourself back up whenever you are down and utilizing everything at your disposal.

Here is a sneak peek at how the gameplay looks like (Recorded on the Meta Quest 3):
